The OkapiBM25 (Best Matching) algorithm finds the best-match scores for the symptoms against the diagnosis. 
It undertakes the weightage of the symptoms, that plays key role diagnosis and detection of the disease, for analysing the relation among them.


For further enhancement compact Singlular Value Decomposition (compact SVDs) has been used to obtain the left-singular vectors, right-singular vector and singular value. 
Then Cosine-Similarity was applied to analyse and find out the score of relevance (scored_weights) of the symptoms with th disease.


During prediction sum of scored_weights for the given symptoms of the patient was choosen as the final relevant score for the provided set of symptoms against every diagnosis. 
The diagnosis, with the highest score was taken as the closest probable while with the lowest score was taken as least probable one.
